Write a Python program that takes three integers as input, representing the sides of a triangle. The program should:

Check if the three sides form a valid triangle using the triangle inequality theorem, which states that for any three sides of a triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side.

If the sides form a valid triangle, determine the type of triangle:

"Equilateral Triangle" if all three sides are equal.
"Isosceles Triangle" if exactly two sides are equal.
"Scalene Triangle" if all three sides are different.
If the sides do not form a valid triangle, print "Not a Valid Triangle".

Example Input/Output:

Input: 5, 5, 5
Output: "Equilateral Triangle"

Input: 7, 10, 5
Output: "Scalene Triangle"

Input: 4, 4, 6
Output: "Isosceles Triangle"

Input: 1, 2, 3
Output: "Not a Valid Triangle"
