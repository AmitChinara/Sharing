Write a Python program that asks the user for their name, age, and height. Then, the program should print a message using these variables in a complete sentence. The message should follow this format:

"Hello, [name]! You are [age] years old and [height] cm tall."

Name should be a string.
Age should be an integer.
Height should be a float (in centimeters).
Ensure that the program handles the correct data types for each input.
